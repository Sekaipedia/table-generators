# Table Generators

Various table generators for Sekaipedia. Currently supported tables are:

- Card levels
- Character Missions
- Character Ranks
- Kizuna Ranks
- Player Ranks

## Usage

There are 3 packages available, one for each mainstream OS (Linux, Mac, and Windows). Alternatively, `table-generators.cjs` can be run standalone, provided that Node 18 is installed.

There is an interactive CLI to generate either a table in wikitext, CSV, or markdown. The wikitext will include templates specifically for Sekaipedia.
